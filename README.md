# Soul Sip'n
When people think of teas, they tend to think of "black tea", "green tea", "herbal tea", etc., but not many people tend to think of the specific _types_ of teas. For instance, "Matcha Tea" is a specific _type_ of Japanese green tea that is ceremoniously whisked into a frothy brew.

Also, tea is very beneficial to your health. Depending on the type of tea your soul wants to sip, your body gets different types of benefits. If you wanted to narrow your searches with remedies for certain ailments, then you can filter your search to your specific needs.

There's so much more to tea than people think and with Soul Sip'n you, as a user, are able to explore the wide variety of teas and improve your knowledge on the **brew**tiful world of tea.

## Technologies Used
For Soul Sip'n we used many different technologies.
- Postgres
- Express
- React
- Node.js

## Getting Started
The team decided to work on the project in many different ways. Lauren and Brock tackled the challenging database structure and seeding information while Jamie handled the front-end portion of CSS and page creations.

## Unsolved Problems
The team had a lot of blockers while making this app. The databases were one of the hardest hurdles to overcome. With the confusing one to many and many to many relationships about the many teas and the many benefits, databases were created and dropped many times. Thankfully, Lauren and Brock were able to create the perfect database for all the tea and benefit info.

Another blocker the team had was connecting the front-end to the back-end. This was the first project where the team had to create two separate repos, one for front-end and one for back-end. In the past, the repos would heavily lean towards one end, but this was the first time where it is equally balanced. The team was able to overcome this blocker with the help of TA's and instructors.

## Future Enhancements
For this project we had a few plans that we didn't quite get to. With the time alloted we just weren't able to implement those features into the final product, but we hope to include them with future updates. Here is what we had in mind.
- Allowing the logged in user to favorite 
- Theme changes based on the type of tea the user is reading on.
