# Soul Sip'n
When people think of teas, they tend to think of "black tea", "green tea", "herbal tea", etc., but not many people tend to think of the specific _types_ of teas. For instance, "Matcha Tea" is a specific _type_ of Japanese green tea that is ceremoniously whisked into a frothy brew.

Also, tea is very beneficial to your health. Depending on the type of tea your soul wants to sip, your body gets different types of benefits. If you wanted to narrow your searches with remedies for certain ailments, then you can filter your search to your specific needs.

There's so much more to tea than people think and with Soul Sip'n you, as a user, are able to explore the wide variety of teas and improve your knowledge on the **brew**tiful world of tea.

## Future Enhancements
For this project we had a few plans that we didn't quite get to. With the time alloted we just weren't able to implement those features into the final product, but we hope to include them with future updates. Here is what we had in mind.
- Allowing the logged in user to favorite 
- Theme changes based on the type of tea the user is reading on.
